## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port conflicts**: Backend runs on 8081, Frontend on 4200
2. **Database connection**: Ensure MySQL is running and credentials are correct
3. **CORS issues**: Check CORS configuration in backend if API calls fail
4. **JWT token expiration**: Tokens expire after 24 hours, re-login required

### Getting Help

- Check the [ENVIRONMENT.md](ENVIRONMENT.md) file for detailed setup instructions
- Ensure all prerequisites are installed with correct versions
- For database issues, verify MySQL service is running
- For frontend issues, clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
```
